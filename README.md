This repository is just a simple practice for me to learn on mapping exercise. The exercise is refer to the online instructor Melanie Walsh. 
The dataset resource is publicly available online for the practices, please refer to [Torn Apart / Separados Project](https://github.com/xpmethod/torn-apart-open-data.git). It maps the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities, as featured in [Volume 1](https://github.com/xpmethod/torn-apart-open-data.git).

This website will show the map location based on your upload image.
